Developing a Storefront based child theme for WordPress.

Main goals are changing the page flow of Woocommerce main and category pages.  Other goal is to create an overlays on the gallery page.

Page flow for store pages:

Header

Focus Image

Maybe a small blurb/short description

Products

Page content, static or in dropdown.

Gallery goal:

Maintain gallery grid

When a visitor clicks on a thumbnail it opens an overlay (see "GalleryGoalSocsAdded.jpg")

Both sides should have previous and next tabs similar to product page tabs

Essential components: Navigation tabs, image, title, materials, completion date(s), long description, any related products.

Page Layout:

Image **Title**<br/>
Image *Materials*<br/>
Image *Category or Origin*<br/>
Image Long description<br/>
Image Socials<br/>

##Featured Products##

Possibly include an **X** to return to the main gallery page.
